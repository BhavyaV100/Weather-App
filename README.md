# Weather App
This is a simple weather app that allows you to search for the current weather conditions of a city. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for a given location, and displays the information on the screen using HTML and CSS.

# How to use the app
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. Enter the name of a city in the search bar and click the "Search" button.
4. The current weather conditions for the selected city will be displayed below.
